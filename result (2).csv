0,Dinesh Kumar,"I am using OnePlus 10R 8GB 128GB more than one month. It is my first ever OnePlus phone. My personal review about this phone is as under:Pros:1. Boxy design looks nice but feels not so premium but if you use its cover it feels nice. Cover quality is very nice.2. Screen is bright even in sunlight if you select auto brightness. Also screen color and touch response feels premium.3. Battery life is very impressive with 1.5 day backup with normal use.4. 80 watt charger is very fast which charge your phone within 30 to 35 minutes.5. I am not a heavy gamer but I tried asfalt 9 which runs very smooth.I think it'll play heavy games smoothly. So it perform well.6. I am new to use Oxygen OS. I feels OS premium and smooth without adds.7. Rear camera shots very good pictures but selfie camera need some improvement which I think can be done via software update.8. No heating issue.9. Lightweight.Cons:1. If you use without case, it doesn't feel like premium phone.2. I don't like the sound quality although is has dual speaker. You can feel vibration on its back pannel which feels very bad.3. Selfie camera needs improvement.4. Zoom is very bad on rear camera.5. No IP certification.6. No expendable storage.7. Paid theme store.8. Should have some dot notch animations like samsung.  At last I can say it is a nice phone with some cons, if you want OnePlus smartphone within Rs. 35000/- you can go for it."
1,Saurabh,"Terrific purchase at the price of 33k. Body I feel light htough it is not as usual OnePlus body as I had been the user of one plus in past also. Metallic sides could be a better option. Sometimes I feel lag in touch though it is for microseconds but it is there. Camera quality is good not awesome. Battery life is good i used to charge once and a day can be completed by itm Obviously, i bought it as it is one of the affordable option in terms of brand. Love to see metallic frames in coming phones. Storage is tremendous and speed is also good m Overall a good purchase a phone can be rated 4 out of 5."
2,BIDESH PATRA,"This smart phone is good enough for daily normal use. But battery life is not good enough though is says 5000 mAh. Camera quality is not good enough in this price segment. Although it's Oxygen os, it is not well optimised. From the starting there will be some lagging issue with some apps. Another bad thing about this smart phone is its form factor. The company taking around 39k but giving just a plastic body which will looks like below 20k. If someone wants to buy this i suggest to buy another model don't go for this model because of the brand. One good thing is oneplus promised three major android update and four years security update. Another bad thing its primary camera design. One of the three camera is so big that it's embracing to say its price is 39k."
3,Prateek H,"I would like to get directly to the pros and consPros.1) BATTERY - The first and the best thing about this phone is the damn battery life and how fast it charges. It's just amazing and I have been kind of spoilt by it now, I wont be able to adjust with a lesser battery performance and charging anymore!2.  CAMERA- The camera is amazing and takes some really amazing pictures. No complains.3. LOOKS - The phone looks really beautiful. I got the forest green colour and it looks simply awesome and is eye catching and premium looking.CONS1) The overall working of the phone is not as seamless as it should be provided the hardware it boasts of. Having said that, the factor cannot be a purchase deterrent. It's otherwise quite smooth2) The absence of an alert slider was a disappointed. I was used to it on my 6T3)Volume - Not too happy with the phone speakers. They somehow are not up to the mark.To sum it up- Just go for it if you have a tight budget but want a premium looking, good performing phone. It packs too much for a 43k phone - good battery, fastest charging in the segment, premium looks, good performance."
4,SHREYANSH KAPADIA,"Using the phone after two days I have noticed weird experience with UI, tapping on grey or black areas screen flickers to that portion and according to service centre it's common issue across all phones and getting fixed by Oxygen 13 update as there were no issue with 10pro.So we have to do nothing but to wait for releasing the new OS update on the 10R and other models as well.Overall device working good so far I experienced average camera results,superb charging but not so extended battery life, touch sensor and speakers are fine and performance is good in my day to day tasks, hopefully UI and OS updates will help to deliver best of this phone."

7,NeerajR7,"Mine phone had air bubbles between the screen protector and display , then i tried push it and its was all fine but this was not expected from oneplus.. like unboxing ka feel kharab kardiyaGood product if you are a student or you might be gifting this to a  teenager or simply if its your first smart phone ..so this might be great choice , i said ‚Äú MIGHT BE ‚Äù so you won‚Äôt t regret if their is no alert slider and this might be worst pick for ‚Äúalready oneplus users‚Äù but i am using iphone so this phone was for my mom so she not kidnaa that much interested in smartphones at all , but if you want some decent smart phone but this one is lil bit expensive as compared to other midrange phones. My variant is 8GB RAM , 128 GB storage and the processor: mediatek dimensity 8100 MAX much heavy name for a not that much heavy processor like its not the worst processor its like not the right one  for this price range and  for oneplus like itna paisa liya hai toh bhai snapdragon de dete but actually i bought this at 35k from amazon in a sale so yes diwali aa rhai hai guys agar 35k and below milta hai toh you can go with it ..camera badhiya hai and battery bhi mast hai  5000 mah, display 120HZ matlab ekdam OP and AMOLED 2k display hai asan bhasha me kahe toh . aslo comes with a 80 W charger jyada farrak nahi hai 60W and 80W me ,phone plastic back me ata hai green colour bhot acha hai but this time ka black jyada hi dark hai phone ka na feel nahi ata hai agar dekhna jaye ‚Ä¶you can aslo go with the new blue colour.. if any queries app questions kar sakte ho ..! Byee.!Note : writing this review after using the phone for 3-4 moth form 16/10/2022 ago‚Ä¶ next will be after a year or 6 monthsüôÇ"
8,VIJAY,Review after 1 month of usageCamera  - back cam is good but front is just waste 10k phones have better front cam than of it ( but again i use gcam so it provides decent photos in front too)Build Quality.  - Though it have plastic build but it looks good but feels like a 10k phone in hand but again everyone use case so doesn't matterDisplay - very beautiful display with 120hz with very tiny bezelsBattery.  - it has decent battery backup like it give me 10-11 hrs of SOT with normal use at 120hz(youtube insta fb) and 4-4.5 hrs of SoT while gaming but it's charger is too fast it charge 100% in just 32-33 min (80 watt)Performance  - I play Bgmi without screen recording on Ace dominator lobby it gives 40 -45 fos in starting of 1 minute on bootcamp and after 1 minute it shift to 55-60 fps in classic it gives 57-60 fps overall decent performance
9,Bratin Dey,Upgraded from OnePlus 7 to 10R 5G for 5G switch over in Delhi.Everything is good except camera. OnePlus 7 has a far better camera. The 48 mp camera in OnePlus 7 is superb. I miss it. OnePlus 10R Sony Imx Lens is somehow ok. Not satisfied at all. I'm a photographer on the sidelines of a Govt job. So bit disappointed with the camera.Overall satisfaction is 7/10.Battery service is exemplary. Vooc Charge is giving full charge from 15% to 100% in 15 minutes.Application access and switch over between applications are super speedy.5G reception and speed are unbelievable. In Delhi I am getting 545mb/sec speed. My daily date of 2gb is getting exhausted in half a day almost.Good buy in 26000 bucks. With exchange. During Diwali.
